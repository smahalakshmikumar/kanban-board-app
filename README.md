# Kanban Board Application

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Project Overview

This project has following:

- Dynamic columns with add, rename, and delete capabilities  
- Task cards with add, edit, delete functionalities  
- Detailed task view including a comments section with add/edit/delete comments  
- Drag-and-drop support for moving and reordering tasks  
- Data persistence across page reloads via `localStorage`  


Additionally, I have also added **some other features** to further enhance the application:

- Nested Reddit-like replies in the comments section  
- Responsive design for seamless use across different screen sizes  
- Keyboard navigation support to move tasks with arrow keys  

This project demonstrates both the required functionality and additional enhancements to deliver a polished, user-friendly Kanban board application.
